#Reflection

Describe the effect each of the P, I, D components had in your implementation.

**P(Proportional term)**:The larger the parameter, the greater the system response speed.But at the same time, it may cause the system to become more and more shock. Please watch the "P.mkv" video.　　

**D(Differential term)**: Mainly used to eliminate system fluctuations caused by proportional items. Please watch the "PD.mkv" video.

**I(Integrate term)**: Mainly used to eliminate systematic bias. Please watch the "PID.mkv" video.

Describe how the final hyperparameters were chosen.

Manual tuning based on experience.
